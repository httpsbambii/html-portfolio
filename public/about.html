<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Mabel, I am eighteen years old and I recently finished my Alevels studying Mathematics, Physics and History.
  
</p>

<p>I am currently on a gap year with the aspiration of having a career in Software Engineering and using this time to expand on my technical skills in web development. Please embark on this journey with me as I strive to become a self-taught software engineer and create projects like this progressing in difficulty.</p>

<p>Thank you:)</p>
